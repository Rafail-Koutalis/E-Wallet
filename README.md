# E-Wallet
This is the very first real app i took part in creating.

To run it, you must run the root_main.py file. You must also install the following modules :
-matplotlib
-tkinter
-os
-sys
-sqlite3

Do not forget to download the smartphone.png, and in case you want to build the app using pyinstaller, you have to download the .ico that is included.
Very very very special thanks to my co-engineers who took part in this project :
-Maria Papananou (Hellenic Open University)
-Athanasios Seretoudis (Hellenic Open University)
